# Context Management

## Applicability

- Applies to: All agents (coordinator has additional responsibilities)

## Rule Content

### Coordinator Must Include Worklog Paths in Task Dispatch

When the coordinator dispatches a task to any agent via the Task tool, the dispatch must include:

1. **Current worklog path**: The directory where this agent must write its outputs (e.g., `.worklog/202603/english-teaching-team/phase-2-planning/`)
2. **Upstream reference paths**: Paths to relevant upstream phase worklogs that this agent must read for context (e.g., `.worklog/202603/english-teaching-team/phase-1-discovery/decisions.md`)
3. **Task scope summary**: A concise description of what this specific task must accomplish (not the entire project context)

The coordinator must not pass full upstream content inline. Pass paths; let the agent read what it needs.

### Agent Return Format: Structured Summaries

When an agent completes a task and returns results to the coordinator, the return must be a structured summary, not raw output:

```markdown
## Task Completion: {task name}

### Status: {Complete / Partial / Blocked}

### Key Outcomes
- {Outcome 1}
- {Outcome 2}

### Decisions Made
- {Decision with brief rationale — full detail in worklog}

### Artifacts Produced
- {file path 1}: {one-line description}
- {file path 2}: {one-line description}

### Worklog Updated
- {worklog path}: {what was written}

### Issues / Blockers (if any)
- {Issue description and suggested resolution}
```

Agents must not return full file contents, complete research dumps, or unstructured narratives. The worklog contains the detail; the return contains the summary.

### Task Isolation via Subagents

Every independent unit of work must be executed as a separate Task (subagent). This ensures natural context isolation:
- Each Task starts with a fresh context window
- The coordinator's context accumulates only summaries, not execution details
- Parallel tasks cannot pollute each other's context

The coordinator must not perform execution work inline (per `rules/coordinator-mandate.md`). All execution goes through Task dispatch.

### Phase-End Archival

At the end of each phase, the coordinator must:

1. Verify the phase worklog is complete (all three core files present and populated)
2. Write a phase completion summary to the coordinator's own tracking (not to the worklog)
3. Release all phase-specific context — subsequent phases read from worklog, not from memory

### Worklog-Based Context Recovery

When work is interrupted or context must be reset:
1. Read the latest phase worklog to restore context
2. Read `decisions.md` from all completed phases for the decision chain
3. Resume from the last completed phase boundary

This enables any agent (or a new session) to pick up work without the original context.

### Context Budget Awareness

Since agents cannot directly measure context window usage, use these proxy indicators:

- **Task count proxy**: After dispatching 5 or more sequential tasks within a single phase, the coordinator must pause and write an interim summary to the worklog before continuing
- **Conversation round proxy**: If an agent's work requires more than 10 back-and-forth exchanges with the coordinator, the agent must summarize progress to the worklog and the coordinator must consider splitting the remaining work into a new Task
- **Output size proxy**: If an agent's response exceeds 3000 words, it must be split — summary returned to coordinator, full content written to worklog

## Violation Determination

- Coordinator dispatches a Task without including the worklog path → Violation
- Coordinator dispatches a Task with full upstream content inline instead of passing worklog paths → Violation
- Agent returns raw unstructured output exceeding 500 words without worklog reference → Violation
- Coordinator performs execution work inline instead of dispatching a Task → Violation
- Phase transition occurs without phase-end archival verification → Violation

## Exceptions

- During Phase 1 Discovery, the coordinator may participate in user-facing conversation directly (this is coordination, not execution)
- Ad-hoc investigation requests to Domain Researcher may include inline context when the context is too small to justify a worklog write (under 200 words)
